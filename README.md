# deep-learning-challenge

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the success of charity funding applications using a neural network model. The project involves preprocessing data, building and training a neural network, and evaluating its performance.

Project Overview
Data Source: Charity application data.
Objective: Predict the likelihood of funding success based on application features.
Model: Deep neural network implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
Files
charity_data.csv: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
starter_code.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, initial model training, and evaluation.
AlphabetSoupCharity.h5: Saved initial neural network model.
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with optimized model training and evaluation.
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5: Saved optimized neural network model.
Results
Initial Model Accuracy: 72%
Optimized Model Accuracy: 72% - achievement was not met.
The optimized model improved performance by adding more layers and tuning hyperparameters.
